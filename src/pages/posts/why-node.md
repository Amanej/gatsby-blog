Why I love Node JS

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Node.js_logo.svg/1200px-Node.js_logo.svg.png">

It all started with <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.

When necessity reared its pretty head, <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> was still the go-to framework for small sites.

So to do any tweaking to themes besides the what you could get away with in admin panel, and to really start building my own projects from scratch I needed <a href="">CSS, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (mainly <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>) and soon <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
I got fairly acquainted with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">WAMP (LAMP)</a> stack but it was all in a haphazard manner.

So after a while I sat down with a 40 hour <a href="https://www.lynda.com/PHP-tutorials/PHP-MySQL-Essential-Training-1-Basics/587674-2.html">course</a> learning the basics of PHP, MySQL I really had a thorough understanding of what was under the hood of what had been abstracted away by <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.

So now building custom themes and even data-driven websites from scratch became a breeze. And on the frontend I started delving deeper beyond the Vanilla JS and <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> world, and experimenting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">Angular</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA frameworks</a>.

But I soon encountered a veritable frustration, I felt I was programming twice. Once for the backend and then for the frontend. So whenever I wanted to implement a frontend feature, I also had to write a lot of code just to handle the incoming request.

It felt so needlessly wasteful.

I had heard the buzz around NodeJS, but I didnt know what or how to actually develop data driven websites with Node. I started experimenting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)">MEAN stack</a>, and although express was very easy. It felt very barebones. It did not have any of the crutches of a CMS like WP or rich ecosystem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails">Rails</a>. You have to stitch it together yourself.

But I was a writing one language. And the amount of effort it took to create a very basic API, server rendered website or SPA was way better.

Years later, it is my goto language. I only write for the web and although I might create a subservice I will always reach for my favorite weapon.

Still everything is not peachy in the garden of Node. In the real world, product managers, senior developers and large consultancies hunger for Java and .NET developers.

Node is still viewed as a plaything. Not long ago, a recruiting officer at a large consultancy told me that although there was demand for frontend JS. PHP and even NodeJS developers very so plentiful that had devalued the market.

I called bullshit, in my mind. PHP maybe. But NodeJS had not been around long enough for it to be devalued.

Although this is was a bit sad, as I do not want to go back to the split world of two different languages for front and back just to earn money. It might just be the curve of adoption. With time, I believe and hope the superior developer experience of writing one language and the ability to cover all platforms will triumph over heavy handed traditional languages and frameworks.

TLDR: Write and think in one language. Write the same language for different platforms and use cases.
