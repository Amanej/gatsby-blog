I built my first webpage for a paying client in 2006. I had learned Dreamviewer early on, and built pages with it and Flash.

My first client was a friend of my mother, that ran an aroma therapy and footclinic downtown, <a href="https://nifty-kilby-cd68a8.netlify.com/">"Aroma & Fotklinikk"</a>. The layout was created by standard table at the time.

Recently, I had the pleasure of renewing this very <a href="http://aromafotklinikk.no">website</a>. Currently the fastest way for me to create the necessary functionality of easy content editing, form submission and other things I used wordpress.
Currently it is still fastest way for me to get a decent, fitting design up and running with a CMS.
