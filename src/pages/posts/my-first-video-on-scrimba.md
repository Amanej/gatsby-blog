This Christmas season I tested out this Norwegian coding tutorial site called <a href="https://scrimba.com">Scrimba</a> which lets you stop and edit code in video.

First of all it was alot fun, meaning the experience of using it was alot of fun. When I first
opened it and started I had some plan to write a <a href="https://nuxtjs.org">Nuxt</a> tutorial (about something).

The only issue is before I started recording I didnt really understand how I can set up my dev environment how I wanted, and instead I just went for a boilerplate <a href="https://vuejs.org">VueJs</a> setup.

The choice of the application was just something I came up with on the spot, and I am not particularly proud of the styling or app logic. But it was a fun trial, and although it left much wanted I still found a decent demo of Vue for a total noob. Watch out for the audio though, my built in audio recorder is crap.

It didnt showcase all of the strengths of Vue, and in fact almost all of the interaction could have been handled by built in Vue attributes added to the HTML elements. I didnt really need several methods.

I am interested in creating a more polished and premium tutorials on Vue/Nuxt and Node/JS relatert subjects and frameworks. If I was going to create them with Scrimba (so I wouldnt have to create screencasts manually), I wish I could do the following:
* Demand payment for watching
* Or whitelist/authenticate users
* Be able edit the video/audi (there were some controls but they seemed complicated)

TLDR: Try Scrimba, its a lot of fun and has some great tutorials. I also recommend Vue and Nuxt.
