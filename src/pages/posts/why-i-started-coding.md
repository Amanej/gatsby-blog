Why I started coding

I grew up in Kolbotn, Norway.

A small suburb outside of Oslo.

My father was a programmer, my grandfather was a programmer, and great-great..no just kidding. But both my father and especially my <a href="https://medium.com/@bedeho
">brother</a> was programmer from an early age. And growing up with computers in my house, I am still surprised at how long it took me to really programing. I probably made my first website at 11, and played around a lot with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver">Dreamweaver</a>, but ActionScript for some reason intimated me. Man, I wish had a time machine.

Anyways, by 16 I had started my first little startup. Dataservicen.net, a computer repair and from then on I could not stop with coming up with ideas. From recycling mobiles to one of the first <a href="https://www.proff.no/selskap/guru-store/%C3%A5s/it-drift-og-support/IGGZIOG0ZDG/">e-commerce platforms</a> on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, I had found my passion.

But I mostly outsourced web development, or got a developer to join (ehhm, my bro ofc). And when I got my last idea, a <a href="https://digible.net">platform 3d printing</a> I knew I had to really do it myself to both do it properly and to develop my self(no pun). Both as a businessman and as a person.

I jumped into it headstart with a subscription to <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a>, and it was a delight. I still always recommend Treehouse to anyone who wants to start coding.

Since then my platform has developed into a real business and I have built websites for some of the biggest companies in Norway from Spar, Hafslund, Oslo Municipality, Santander and many others.

So thinking about coding ? Go ahead, get started and dont postphone it for over 10 years like I did!
